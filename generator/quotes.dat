To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.
That it will never come again is what makes life so sweet.
It is never too late to be what you might have been. 
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.
Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.
All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players.
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.
Unable are the loved to die for love is immortality.
Let me live, love, and say it well in good sentences.
Don't let your happiness depend on something you may lose.
We are all broken, that's how the light gets in.
Appreciation is a wonderful thing. It makes what is excellent in others belong to us as well.
Life is tough my darling, but so are you.
Self-awareness and self-love matter. Who we are is how we lead.
Amateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and go to work.
Get it down. Take chances. It may be bad, but it's the only way you can do anything really good.
As a writer, you should not judge, you should understand.
To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.
Ideas are like rabbits. You get a couple and learn how to handle them, and pretty soon you have a dozen.
Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.
The Six Golden Rules of Writing: Read, read, read, and write, write, write.
As for ‘Write what you know,' I was regularly told this as a beginner. I think it's a very good rule and have always obeyed it. I write about imaginary countries, alien societies on other planets, dragons, wizards, the Napa Valley in 22002. I know these things. I know them better than anybody else possibly could, so it's my duty to testify about them.
You should write because you love the shape of stories and sentences and the creation of different words on a page. Writing comes from reading, and reading is the finest teacher of how to write.
Find out the reason that commands you to write; see whether it has spread its roots into the very depth of your heart; confess to yourself you would have to die if you were forbidden to write.
The purpose of a writer is to keep civilization from destroying itself.
A writer never has a vacation. For a writer life consists of either writing or thinking about writing.
Read, read, read. Read everything – trash, classics, good and bad, and see how they do it. Just like a carpenter who works as an apprentice and studies the master. Read! You'll absorb it. Then write. If it's good, you'll find out. If it's not, throw it out of the window.
A good writer possesses not only his own spirit but also the spirit of his friends.
Your writing voice is the deepest possible reflection of who you are. The job of your voice is not to seduce or flatter or make well-shaped sentences. In your voice, your readers should be able to hear the contents of your mind, your heart, your soul.
I am not at all in a humour for writing; I must write on until I am.
You don't start out writing good stuff. You start out writing crap and thinking it's good stuff, and then gradually you get better at it. That's why I say one of the most valuable traits is persistence.
You can always edit a bad page. You can't edit a blank page.
Do not hoard what seems good for a later place in the book, or for another book; give it, give it all, give it now.
If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it.
Tears are words that need to be written.
You cannot find peace by avoiding life
The strongest principle of growth lies in the human choice
Focus more on your desire than on your doubt, and the dream will take care of itself.
We have to continually be jumping off cliffs and developing our wings on the way down.
I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something.
Don't bend; don't water it down; don't try to make it logical; don't edit your own soul according to the fashion. Rather, follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly.
Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great.
Maybe it's not about having a beautiful day, but about finding beautiful moments. Maybe a whole day is just too much to ask. I could choose to believe that in every day, in all things, no matter how dark and ugly, there are shards of beauty if I look for them.
Trust our heart if the seas catch fire, live by love though the stars walk backwards.
One day I will find the right words, and they will be simple.
I can be changed by what happens to me. But I refuse to be reduced by it.
The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.
I want to taste and glory in each day, and never be afraid to experience pain.
If I waited for perfection, I would never write a word.
How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.
We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.
